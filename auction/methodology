1. Start by nominating a random player from the available player pool
    a. Top 10 players by Value over Replacement (VOR) are eligible, to limit high-tier players from falling too far and low-tier players from being nominated too early
    b. Players are weighted by their VOR, so higher VOR players within the group are more likely to be nominated

2. A list of eligible teams is generated and a random initial bid amount is chosen based on a uniform distribution between the player's minimum and maximum prices
    a. Team eligibility is based on several factors:
        i.   The team has an open roster spot and does not need to fill another position (i.e., final pick with DST still required)
        ii.  The team has not reached the nominated player's position limit
        iii. If selected, the team's remaining budget does not fall below $1 per remaining roster spot (i.e., they can fill their roster with a minimum $1 bid per player)
        iv.  If it's the team's last pick, the bid amount does not drop their budget below $0
    b. If no team is eligible, the bid amount is subtracted by $1 until at least one team can draft the player
    c. If the bid amount reaches $0, the nominated player is removed from the player pool and process is restarted with a new player

3. Each eligible team is then assigned probability of winning the bid based on several factors:
    a. Aggression level - a randomly assigned value between 1 (high) and 3 (low) set prior to that draft's simulation
    b. Roster scarcity - teams with fewer drafted players than expected are given a higher probability
    c. Position scarcity - teams with fewer drafted players at the nominated player's position are given a higher probability
    d. Wait time - teams that waited longer since their last pick are assigned a higher probability

4. The winning team is then randomly selected and the player is added to their roster
    a. Remaining player prices are adjusted based on the inflation/deflation resulting from winning bid

5. Steps 1-4 are repeated until all rosters are filled

Once the draft is completed, an entire season (including playoffs) is simulated to quantify draft strategies
